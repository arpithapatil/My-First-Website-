      <h4>Hi!! I am Ellisa!!</h4>
<p> Growing up in Boston,I was never a big traveler. I didn’t take my first trip overseas until I was 23. 
    Outside of a cruise and college trip to Montreal, I had no travel experience. After college, I got a job and the standard
    American two-weeks-a-year vacation. I wanted to use that time to travel. After all,it was vacation time,<br> right? So for my
    first trip overseas in 2004, I went to Costa Rica. That trip changed my life. It opened me up to the possibilities of the world. 
    In Costa Rica, I experienced other cultures, got lost in a jungle, saw conservation projects in action, and met people from around the world.
    From that moment on, I was hooked on travel. All I wanted to do was travel, see more of the world, and learn more about the people in it.<br>
    Have you ever thought:<br>
   “How do I find the money to travel?”<br>
   “Where do I find good travel deals?”<br>
   “How do I save money on flights, accommodation, and other big expenses?”<br>
   “How do I plan my trip?”<br>
   “How do I stay safe and healthy?”<br>
   “How do I maximize my time?”<br>
   “I want to travel more but I don’t know the first step.”<br>
    You are not alone. Over the past several years, I’ve helped millions of people answer those questions and travel more with tested and proven tips and advice.
    This way, you can spend less time searching the Internet and being overwhelmed with information and more time doing the one thing you want to do: travel more.</p>
